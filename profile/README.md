## Lack of social mobility is one of the UKâ€™s greatest challenges

The social mobility ecosystem is vast but fragmented. There are millions of talented, diverse, underrepresented young people. Thousands of wonderful, impactful programmes and interventions and thousands of employers seeking diverse talent.

Mission Beyond is a unique social enterprise connecting those young people from underrepresented groups with support providers and employment opportunities to help them realise their potential.

Our goal is to help 1 million underestimated young adults on to the path of economic independence
